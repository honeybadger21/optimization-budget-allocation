Optimal-budget-allocation-strategy: Marketing budgets now comprise 11 percent of total company budgets, based on a CMO survey sponsored by the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, Deloitte LLP, and the American Marketing Association. However, the effectiveness of marketing varies significantly. One potential reason for such variation is the way of making marketing budget allocations. Namely, how much to invest in each advertisement platform. In this project, we use linear programming to build a simple marketing budget allocation strategy.
